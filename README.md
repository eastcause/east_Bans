# east_Bans
The project is incomplete. I put it aside, because I don't have time at the moment. One day I will finish it.
It is a ban plugin that works on the basis of a database that is located on our proxy server, from the level of bukkia we execute a command that is executed on the proxy server by the player who performed it on the bukkit server.
For example, a player on a bukkit server enters /ban nick reason 30d server=pvp,survival - the use of the command is sent to bungeecord and there the player uses the /gban command with the same arguments.
